# Legal Structure and Responsibility

## Infrastructure Provider Model

BizNode is developed and maintained as open-source infrastructure by 1BZ DZIT DAO LLC.

1BZ DZIT DAO LLC acts solely as:

- Software developer
- Infrastructure designer
- Open-source maintainer

1BZ DZIT DAO LLC does NOT:

- Operate deployed BizNode instances
- Control user-deployed Telegram bots
- Manage user email systems
- Supervise autonomous business actions

Each BizNode instance operates independently under the control of its deploying user.

## Independent Node Model

Every BizNode:

- Runs on user-controlled infrastructure
- Uses user-configured API keys
- Uses user-configured email credentials
- Operates under user-defined parameters

Therefore:

The deploying user is the legal operator of their node.

## Network Interaction

BizNode may allow interaction with other nodes in the 1BZ Network.

1BZ DZIT DAO LLC does not guarantee:

- Legitimacy of third-party nodes
- Trustworthiness of associate network participants
- Performance or compliance of network partners

All inter-node collaboration is voluntary and user-governed.

## No Agency Relationship

Nothing in this software creates:

- Partnership
- Agency
- Joint venture
- Fiduciary relationship

between 1BZ DZIT DAO LLC and any user.
